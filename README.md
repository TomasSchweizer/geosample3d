# geosample3d







## Reference

The overall package setup is inspired by [fpsample](https://github.com/leonardodalinky/fpsample/tree/main).

The bucket-based FPS algorithm is based on the following papers and taken from 
the authors repo [bucket-based_farthest-point-sampling_CPU](https://github.com/hanm2019/bucket-based_farthest-point-sampling_CPU/blob/main/README.md).
